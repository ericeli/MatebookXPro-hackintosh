The project is still in its beta/testing state.
Proceed at your own risk, I shall not take responsibility for any damages caused.

### For quick post installation, please run this in terminal:
```
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gnodipac886/MatebookXPro-hackintosh/master/onekey_installer.sh)"
```

## My Matebook X Pro's Hardware Configuration:
- CPU: i7-8550U @ 1.8GHz
- 16GB RAM
- Nvidia MX 150 / Intel UHD 620
- 3K display @ 3000x2000
- 512 Gb Toshiba SSD
- USB Wifi: Edimax N150 (2.4 GHz only but cheap) / [Edimax AC1200 (2.4 + 5GHz)](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01MY7PL10/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
- Builtin Bluetooth: Intel Wireless Bluetooth 8275

## What works:
- Intel WiFi (AC8275)
- Intel UHD 620 Graphics Acceleration
- Brightness
- Sleep
- Realtek alc256 Audio via AppleALC
- Keyboard with Volume Controls and Brightness controls (via VoodooPS2)
- Camera support up to 10.14.3
- Trackpad and Native Gestures via Custom VoodooI2C
- Touchscreen with multi-touch capabilities (think of it as a large trackpad)
- Battery Percentage
- Bluetooth (Reboot from Widows required - should persist after single reboot)
- Power Management - I'm getting around 8-9 hours.
- Liton SSDs are now supported.
- HDMI 2.0 support, up to two 4K @60Hz monitors. 

## What doesn't Work:
- dGPU (Nvidia Optimus not supported on MacOS)
- eGPU (not tested)
- Fingerprint Sensor
- As of right now, Samgsung PM981 SSDs are not supported.

## Let's Get Started

### What you need:
- Huawei Matebook X Pro (either i7 or i5 model)
- macOS or OS X downloaded from the Mac App Store
- 8GB USB stick
- USB C dock (for connecting to external mouse for initial setup)

### BIOS Settings
- f2 is for booting into BIOS
- f12 is for boot override
- Any version of the BIOS is good, but I'm on version 1.26
- Restore Defaults
- Disable Secure boot
- Matebook's BIOS is rewrite protected, EFI tool is useless against this BIOS.

## Installing with a macOS Device
- Please refer to [this issue post](https://github.com/gnodipac886/MatebookXPro-hackintosh/issues/69#issue-548569933) for a detailed guide.

## Installing Without a macOS Device

> If you are having trouble with this method, [here](https://github.com/gnodipac886/MatebookXPro-hackintosh/blob/master/install-without-windows.md) is a more detailed guide.

If you don't have a machine running MacOS, you can easily create your bootable USB following these steps:

1. Download [gibMacOS Scripts](https://github.com/corpnewt/gibMacOS)
2. Run `gibMacOS.bat`
3. Run `MakeInstall.bat`
4. Open BOOT USB drive. Open EFI folder. Delete BOOT and CLOVER folders. Copy over the BOOT and CLOVER folders from Repo's USB-EFI folder.
> You can copy over any WiFi dongle drivers or tools you may need onto your USB for post installation
5. Boot from USB and select `"Boot macOS install from OS X Base System"`
6. System will reboot choose option `"Boot macOS from <your_drive_name>"`
> If stuck in a boot loop add -disablegfxfirmware to Clover Option Boot Args

## Post Installation

Please run this code in terminal:
```
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gnodipac886/MatebookXPro-hackintosh/master/onekey_installer.sh)"
```

You should now be at your desktop.

Download
- [Clover Configurator Pro](https://github.com/Micky1979/Clover-Configurator-Pro/blob/master/Updates/CCP_v1.4.1.zip?raw=true)
- USB Wi-fi Drivers
- Newest [Clover Bootloader](https://sourceforge.net/projects/cloverefiboot/), and install it to your boot disk

Mount EFI partition if not mounted already

Clone the repository via terminal or download it and swap the CLOVER folder downloaded for the one in your EFI directory.

***Note if you have the i5 version, or any other configurations of the laptop sold exclusively in China***, you should:
- For i5 models: you have to make a custom CPUFriendProvider for Power Management by following [this](https://github.com/stevezhengshiqi/one-key-cpufriend) guide:

## Dual Booting Fix

After Windows updates, Clover EFI might be ignored making your system boot straight to Windows.
This is usually caused by a Windows update affecting EFI files. Here's how to fix it:

1. Grab the [gibMacOS Scripts](https://github.com/corpnewt/gibMacOS)
2. Run `MakeInstall.bat`
3. Choose to install clover only in the script - for example, if your drive number is `1` then enter `1C` for the `MakeInstall.bat` script and press enter
4. Boot from your USB that you installed Clover to and go to MacOS
5. Mount your boot disk EFI partition using Clover Configurator
6. In `EFI/Microsoft` or `EFI/Windows` rename the boot EFIs (`boot.efi` and `bootmgfw.efi`) to `<original_name>-orig.efi`.

That's it! Dual boot should be fixed.

## Activate Surround Sound via MIDI
1. Open Audio MIDI Setup from applications
2. Click on the "+" symbol on the bottom left corner
3. Click "Create Muti-Output Device"
4. Check both of the Built-in Output options 
5. Select the newly created device in the menu bar
6. Enjoy your music!

> (Note, there is no volume control for multi-channel devices in macOS, so in order to change the volume, you'd have to change the individual volume on each output, or get dedicated software)

## Bluetooth Fix (Deprecated)

Before any of this, make sure you have bluetooth avaliable in the menu, even if it says no hardware detected

1. Download: [VMware](https://www.vmware.com/go/getfusion), and Tinycorelinux [Core.iso](http://tinycorelinux.net/10.x/x86/release/Core-10.1.iso)  
2. Boot the iso file with VMware  
3. Run the following command in terminal: 
```
$ tce-load -wil bluez usbutils firmware-intel  
```  
4. From the Core's Bluetooth settings, uncheck "Share Bluetooth devices with Linux"  
5. Now, you should see Intel Bluetooth in the list of devices above  
6. Check the Intel Bluetooth box and wait for about 4-5 seconds, during this time, the check may flicker, this is ok  
7. Then uncheck the box, and you should see bluetooth is now avaliable to macOS.

> Instead of shutting down the VM, pause it and quit VMware. This saves you trouble of having to re-type the command each time, just repeat steps 4 - 7.

# Updates

### 6/1/2020: Minor adjustments
- Main update: Intel-WiFi is now supported, due to the limited support of this repo, please follow the steps below:
	1. In order to setup WiFi, please run my wifiLaunch.command script, this saves your password into the kext
	2. After the initial setup, you can just run loadWiFi.sh script
	3. Whenever you want to connect to a different WiFi, please run wifiLaunch.command again
	> I am able to get 70+ mbps on my 100 mbps plan
- For more information about this update, please check out [profzei's repo](https://github.com/profzei/Matebook-X-Pro-2018), even though his repo is based off of mine, he has done tremendous amounts of work on his own to cover for the time that I've been absent. He's done lots of backend work to make this laptop run smoother. Please drop him a star on his repo if you have the chance!
- I've been working OC support, will come back soon! But first, I've got a summer internship :) wish me luck! 


### 1/1/2020: Update of the Decade

- Still working on optimizing battery, you may try patching DSDT with the common DSDT patches mentioned [here](https://www.tonymacx86.com/threads/guide-patching-laptop-dsdt-ssdts.152573/) to get a better idea.

### 6/1/2019: Pretty big update
- New Autoinstaller that just installs everything for you in jsut one click (EFI partition NEEDS to be disk0s1)
- We now use SSDT hotpatch for everything (no DSDT patching needed, plug and play)
- iMessage, Facetime, and Siri now work again (you do need to inject system definition: follow this [tutorial](https://www.tonymacx86.com/threads/an-idiots-guide-to-imessage.196827/))
- Now supports up to two 4k@60hz monitors
- New platform ID for better support (4k monitors etc. (ID: 0x591C0005))
- Disable hibernation mode in script

- Better audio: speakers are now louder, you can always just use voodooHDA but you will lose headphone detection
- WhatEverGreen updated to version 1.2.8
- VoodooI2C kext updated
- Note* you still need to patch your DSDT for trackpad to work, and brightness keys to work.


### 4/11/2019: New LiteOn Patch
- If you have problems updating to 10.14.4 (seeing a prohibited sign), its likely that the problem is caused by your liteon drive, please replace the following patch in your config.plist before you update.
```
      <dict>
        <key>Comment</key>
        <string>IONVMeFamily: Ignore FLBAS bit:4 being set - for Plextor/LiteOn/Hynix</string>

```
    sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/daliansky/XiaoMi-Pro/master/one-key-cpufriend/one-key-cpufriend.sh)"

```
- Undervolt the CPU/GPU/Cache via a shell: Place the new "voltageshift" file into your downloads folder and run the "voltageset.command" script to undervolt, and the "voltageinfo.command" to check your results. Furthermore, you can also set custom values to what you would like to undervolt to based on your hardware (i5 vs i7) by editing the script.
